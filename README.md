## Introduction

Competitive programming is a sport where coders compete to solve complex problems within a limited time frame. This repository is dedicated to providing efficient solutions to such problems, with a focus on:

- **Optimization:** Both memory and time.
- **Readability:** Clear, concise code with comprehensive comments.
- **Scalability:** Solutions are designed to handle large inputs gracefully.

## Features

- **100% C++:** All solutions are implemented in C++ for maximum performance.
- **Detailed Comments:** Each line of code includes comments explaining the logic and purpose.
- **Optimized Solutions:** Emphasis on using the most efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
